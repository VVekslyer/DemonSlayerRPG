 - [ ] If a player attack, a sound effect should play, the demon will flash red for just a bit, and the amount of damage dealt will be displayed.
 - [ ] After the player's turn, it'll be the demon's turn. When they attack, they flash red, and perform a sound effect. The dialouge box will display how much damage was dealt to what party member.
